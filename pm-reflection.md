# Project Manager Reflection

## How I Came Up With My Idea
The idea for this website came from wanting to create a simple, jewels and diamond info website where enthusiasts can come reguarly to get updated about what is happening the luxury industry and where and when are the main auctions taking place.

## Collaboration With the Developer
The collaboration went smoothly overall. I provided feedback on the first version, pointing out issues with missing styles, broken image links, and incomplete pages. My developer, Michelle was responsive and quickly fixed the issues. Therefore, me and Michelle were able to maintain open communication, which made addressing problems and implementing improvements efficient.

## What I Learned About Writing Requirements
I learned that clear, detailed, and structured requirements are crucial. Providing examples and specifying exactly what should be fixed or implemented helped Michille understand my vision, where she wass initially confused. Breaking tasks into smaller goals, like linking images or completing specific pages, made the development process more manageable and reduced misunderstandings.

## Use of AI Tools
I did not use AI tools for this part of this part of the project.
